## Work Experience
**Full Stack Developer @ Walmart (July 2023- Jan 2024)**
-In my role as a software developer, I've made significant strides in enhancing system scalability and reliability by leveraging a robust tech stack. Employing Spring Boot and Kubernetes, I led the development of RESTful APIs and deployed microservices, resulting in a notable 15% improvement in scalability. Harnessing Azure for cloud infrastructure management, I optimized resource utilization and achieved cost-effectiveness. Apache Kafka played a pivotal role in designing event-driven architectures for real-time data streaming, crucial for mission-critical processes. Rigorous testing using JUnit, Mockito, and Postman ensured high code quality and reliability. React was instrumental in crafting modular and responsive user interfaces, while tools like SonarQube bolstered security and minimized vulnerabilities. Collaboration with cross-functional teams was facilitated through platforms like JIRA, ensuring seamless project management and successful delivery.
**Software Engineer @ computerEdge (Aug 2022 - May 2023 )**
-In my versatile role, I've utilized AngularJS to enhance Java applications with dynamic web interfaces. Within the Spring framework, I've optimized batch processing and orchestrated microservices, reducing code vulnerabilities by 30% with Spring Boot Security. Integrating AngularJS with RESTful APIs streamlined communication. Spearheading AWS cloud services, I specialized in file processing for scalability. Rigorous testing and efficient deployment were ensured through CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins and deployment automation strategies.

**Research Assistant @ University of Missouri KansasCity (Dec 2021- June 2022)**
-In my role, I conduct extensive research on emerging trends in Java programming and related technologies. I've developed and maintained JSON-driven web applications, leveraging Java, JSP, and a suite of Spring technologies. By applying modern JavaScript features and integrating tools like Node.js and jQuery, I've enhanced code readability and user interface functionality. Additionally, I've designed fault-tolerant cloud solutions using Azure services, resolved performance bottlenecks in multi-threaded applications, and gained expertise in cloud technologies like Azure and AWS.

**Software Engineer @ Diebold Nixdorf (Dec 2020- June 2021)**
-As a software Engineer, I've developed and maintained Remote Systems using Spring Boot and Microservices, resulting in enhanced functionality and reduced downtime. Expertise in DOM manipulation with vanilla JavaScript and jQuery enriched user interfaces. Leveraging AWS services like ECS, EC2, and RDS ensured a cost-efficient, scalable deployment environment. UI Config pages were developed using Angular and JavaScript, with Jenkins automating CI/CD processes, bolstering team productivity. Proficiency in NodeJS enabled building scalable applications, while participation in code reviews and unit testing ensured software quality and early defect detection.

## Projects
### Remote Data Integrity: (JSP, JDBC, JavaScript, Html, CSS, Java,Oracle, Apache Tomcat)
-	This project helps the client to store the data securely in Cloud using third party auditor and primary key generator. Apache Tomcat is used to integrated with other technologies, such as databases, messaging systems, and caching solutions, to create complex and powerful web applications. Used Html and CSS along with bootstrap for the application front-end part.
-	The project implements robust encryption mechanisms to ensure data security during storage in the cloud. By integrating Apache Tomcat with various technologies like databases and messaging systems, the application can handle diverse data processing requirements efficiently. The use of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the frontend ensures a user-friendly and visually appealing interface, enhancing the overall user experience.
### A server without a server: (Amazon Services)
- Using serverless cloud computing architecture will allow you to deploy products more quickly and efficiently. In addition, serverless websites provide several benefits, including scalability, the ability to charge users depending on their use of serverless environments such as DynamoDB, API, S3, and consumption. Used AWS Lambda as serverless computes either behind APIs or to react to asynchronous events.
-	With AWS Lambda as a serverless compute option, teams can seamlessly scale resources based on demand, ensuring optimal performance while reducing operational complexities. This approach fosters agility and innovation, empowering teams to iterate rapidly and respond efficiently to changing business needs.
### Hazard Detection and Alert system to Prevent Incident: (android studio, Reactnative, Arduino, BLE, Esp32)
-	Safety hazard involving heavy fleet vehicles and crews on backing Incidents. Potential alternative system directions using state-of-art-technologies (SOTA). Built a WPS hardware (Esp. 32 based small form-factor prototype) Perform unit testing.
